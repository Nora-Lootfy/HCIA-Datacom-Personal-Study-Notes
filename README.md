# 📘 HCIA-Datacom – Personal Study Notes

This repository contains **personal summaries and study notes** for **HCIA-Datacom (Huawei Certified ICT Associate – Data Communication)**.

These notes are created during my learning journey to:

- 🔁 Make **revision easier** before the exam

This repository is **not an official Huawei course** and **not a replacement for official documentation** — it is a **personal learning notebook**, organized in a clean and practical way.

## ✍️ Notes Style

To keep the notes effective and readable:
- **Bold text** → key definitions
- Bullet points → important characteristics
- Tables → comparisons and summaries
- Simple language → focus on understanding

The notes are intentionally:
- ✅ Beginner-friendly
- ✅ Structured
- ✅ Exam-oriented
